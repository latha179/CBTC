# To-DO List

To develop a basic to-do app that enables users to add, view, and complete tasks, we can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

# Features

- Add New Tasks: Users can add new tasks to a list.

- View Tasks: All tasks are displayed in a list format.

- Mark as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete, moving them to a separate "Completed Tasks" list.

- Date and Time: Optionally, add date and time information to tasks when they are created and completed.

# Implementation Outline

- HTML: Create the structure of the web app with input fields, buttons, and lists.
 Defines the structure of the to-do app with input fields, buttons, and unordered lists (<ul>) for tasks.
 
- CSS: Style the app for a better user experience.
     Styles the app, making it visually appealing and easier to interact with.
     
- JavaScript: Add functionality to handle task addition, completion, and display:
  
            - addTask(): Adds a new task to the task list. If the input is empty, it returns without adding the task.
            - completeTask(): Moves the task from the task list to the completed task list and marks it as completed. Optionally, adds 
                            date and time when the task was added and completed.
